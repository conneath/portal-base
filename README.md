# portal-base
yup, its the Portal source code from that 2018 Source Engine leak but slapped onto the sdk 2013, have fun and go wild<BR>
**THIS REQUIRES PORTAL TO BE IN THE SAME STEAMAPPS DIRECTORY AS YOUR SOURCEMODS!**
## Compiling
run the bat file in src and compile the solution (don't forget to set the project to Release, not Debug)
basically exactly the same as source sdk 2013

## Note
when done compiling, copy the "portal" folder in game, put it in sourcemods and rename it to "mod_portal" (or just.. rename "mod_portal_english.txt" to whatever your mod's folder is)
